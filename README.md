# Egg-Timer
This is an Egg Timer app built with Swift that allows you to boil your eggs to perfection depending on your preference.

## By building this app, I learnt the following concepts in Swift:

Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
The Swift Timer API
Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
Conditional statements - Switch
Functions with outputs
How to use the ProgressView

## Usage

Once you open the app, you will be presented with a screen where you can select how you like your eggs to be boiled: soft, medium, or hard. Once you select your preference, you can start the timer by tapping the "Start" button.

During the timer countdown, you can see the progress of the timer on a progress bar. When the timer is done, an alert will appear letting you know that your eggs are ready.
